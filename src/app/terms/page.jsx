              Legal Advice.
              <p>
                Through the Service’s online platform, rental.kg provides
                an automated software solution to Rental Managers who choose to
                prepare their own lease documents, and to execute those
                documents with Renters electronically. The platform includes
                general information on commonly encountered business and legal
                issues. The Service may also include a review of your answers
                for completeness, spelling, internal consistency, and other
                clerical functions. At no time do we review your answers or
                draft or completed leases for legal sufficiency, draw legal
                conclusions, provide legal advice, opinions or recommendations
                about your legal rights, remedies, defenses, options, selection
                of forms, or strategies, or apply the law to the facts of your
                particular situation. rental.kg is not a law firm and may
                not perform services performed by an attorney. rental.kg,
                its Service, and its forms or templates are not a substitute for
                the advice or services of an attorney.
              </p>
              <p>
                rental.kg strives to keep its lease forms current and
                up-to-date. However, because the law changes rapidly,
                rental.kg cannot guarantee that all of the information
                provided in conjunction with its Service is completely current.
                The law is different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and may
                be subject to interpretation by different courts. The law is a
                personal matter, and no general information or legal tool like
                the kind rental.kg provides can fit every circumstance.
                Furthermore, the legal information contained on any
                rental.kg website or provided in conjunction with the
                delivery of the Service is not legal advice and is not
                guaranteed to be correct, complete or up-to-date. Therefore, if
                you need legal advice for your specific problem, or if your
                specific problem is too complex to be addressed by our tools, or
                simply have legal questions about the leasing process, you
                should consult a licensed attorney in your area.
              </p>

                The use of any part of the Service is not intended to create any
                attorney-client relationship, and your use of rental.kg
                does not and will not create an attorney-client relationship
                between you and rental.kg. Instead, you are and will be
                representing yourself in any legal matter you undertake through

                payments, and management of listings on the Listing Service
                (“User Management Tools”). Rental Managers that elect to use the
                User Management Tools are solely responsible for all activity

                . Rental Manager acknowledges and agrees that, as part of the
                Service, rental.kg creates for each Rental Manager a
                TransUnion account and that rental.kg provides to
                TransUnion default values of credit risk tolerance on behalf of
                the Rental Manager. If Rental Manager wishes to change such
                credit risk value, it may so by contacting TransUnion at the
                number supplied below. If you experience issues with your
                Consumer Report, please contact TransUnion customer service at

              Consumer Reports - Additional Acknowledgements by Rental Managers.
              <p>
                If Rental Manager receives consumer reports from TransUnion,
                which are delivered by rental.kg through the platform, the
                following terms and conditions apply: (a) Rental Manager
                acknowledges and agrees that any decision to be returned through
                a message via the platform (whether by default or otherwise)
                reflects only that the results returned from TransUnion do not
                meet the criteria established by the Rental Manager, and
                represents the Rental Manager’s screening requirements and
                policy. (b) Rental Manager is solely responsible for any
                decisions it makes based on such requirements and policy as well
                as any screening outcomes provided by TransUnion through
                rental.kg and/or its affiliates to the extent based on such
                message. (c) Rental Manager acknowledges and agrees that any
                communication with any applicant concerning Rental Manager’s
                decision to decline the application (i) shall state that the
                decision is a consequence of the applicant not meeting Rental
                Manager’s internal policy rules and (ii) shall not name
                rental.kg as a source for implementation of Rental
                Manager’s internal policy rules. (d) Rental Manager assumes all
                responsibility for ensuring compliance with any federal, state,
                and local law or rule that may govern or relate to the request
                and/or use of Service requested and received through the
                platform, including but not limited to, consent to screening,
                use of information provided through the Service, any notices to
                be provided to consumers, and acquisition of consumer reports
                and public record data. <br />

              Fees; Payments; Taxes.
              <p>
                By using this Service, (a) you may be required to pay fees to
                rental.kg to access certain features of the Service, as
                described within the platform. All fees are in U.S. dollars and
                are non-refundable. Renter acknowledges and agrees that (i) that
                such fee is being paid to rental.kg, and not to the Rental
                Manager, for the convenience of using the Service and (ii)
                Renter may choose not to use the Service, and instead apply
                directly to the Rental Manager at no cost. (b) You agree to pay
                all charges incurred by you or on your behalf through the
                Service, at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred.
                Payment of all fees shall be made through Rental.kg’s
                third-party payment processors. Such third party payment
                processors will charge you the fees as described in these Terms
                and Conditions and the platform for the Service prior to you
                making your payment in the payment method you specified at the
                time of purchase. If you pay any fees with a debit card or
                credit card, Rental.kg’s third-party payment processors may
                seek pre-authorization of your debit card or credit card account
                before your purchase to verify that the debit card or credit
                card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to
                cover your purchase. By making or receiving payments through the
                Payment Portal, you grant rental.kg and our third-party
                payment processors the right, power, and authority to act on
                your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial
                information from the relevant institution, and to charge your
                account in the amounts specified in these Terms and Conditions
                and the platform for the Service. (c) You are responsible for
                any taxes applicable to your transactions sent or received
                through the Payment Portal. <br />

                process a transaction requested by the Renter; (j) will not add
                any additional fees, including, but not limited to, payment

                You may terminate your account at any time by contacting
                support@rental.kg. You may cancel any rent payment not
                already in process in your account dashboard. If you terminate
                your account, you remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees,
                if any, incurred prior to termination relating to your use of
                the Service. If you violate any provision of these Terms and

                required to do so by any third party. rental.kg may alter,
                suspend or discontinue the Service or the platform without
                notice. Any termination by a Renter or Rental Manager of their

                between a Renter and Rental Manager, or a Renter or Rental
                Manager and a third-party, and both Renter and Rental Manager
                will remain bound by the terms of the underlying agreement

                Privacy Policy and any third party terms and conditions as
                provided in the platform; (c) your violation of any law or the
                rights of a third-party; and (d) any dispute or issue between
                you and any third-party, including any other Renter or Rental
                Manager user of the Service or any third-party vendor.

              Relationship of the Parties.
              <p>
                By accepting these terms, Renters and Rental Managers agree as
                follows: (a) rental.kg is acting as an independent
                contractor with respect to the Service. Neither Renter nor
                Rental Manager shall (i) be considered an employee or agent of
                the rental.kg; nor (ii) have any authority under this
                Agreement to bind or otherwise obligate the rental.kg on
                any matter whatsoever. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
                be construed to imply a partnership, agency, or any other
                fiduciary relationship between the rental.kg and Renter and
                Rental Manager. (b) rental.kg will not be bound by the
                terms of any lease or other agreement entered into between a
                Renter and Rental Manager, and will not be liable for any breach
                of such agreement by either a Renter or Rental Manager. (c)
                rental.kg will not be liable whatsoever on account of any
                change to the Service or any suspension or termination of your
                access to or use of the platform. (d) In facilitating the
                delivery of emails/notices between Rental Managers and Renters
                in connection with the provision of other property management
                services, rental.kg is merely acting as third-party service
                provider and in forwarding any emails or notices to Renters on
                behalf of Rental Managers, is not acting as a debt collector or
                agent on behalf of any Rental Manager. (e) In providing sample
                text for emails or notices to be sent, rental.kg is not
                providing legal advice to any party, and strongly recommends
                that Rental Managers consult with an attorney prior to using any
                sample language. (f) By requesting any notices be sent to
                Renters, Rental Managers are affirming to rental.kg and to
                Renters that: (i) Rental Managers have reviewed the content of
                the notices and have determined they are appropriate for Rental
                Manager’s purposes; (ii) are consistent with all applicable law;
                (iii) that Rental Managers direct rental.kg to send the
                notices on their behalf, but not as their agent; and (iv) Rental
                Manager is deemed to be the author of the content of the emails
                and not rental.kg. (g) In providing this Service,
                rental.kg makes no rental decision regarding any
                application for housing, and is not the party determining the
                nature or amount of any outstanding lease obligation, including
                rental amounts, fees, deposits, etc. <br />

                You agree not to export from anywhere any part of the Service or
                the platform provided to you or any direct product thereof
                except in compliance with, and with all licenses and approvals
                required under, applicable export laws, rules and regulations.
                rental.kg reserves the right to change these Terms and
                Conditions at any time in its sole discretion on a going-forward
                basis. rental.kg may notify you of such changes by any
                reasonable means, including by posting a revised Terms and
                Conditions on the platform. Any changes will be effective
                immediately upon posting the revised version of these Terms and
                Conditions on the platform. Your continued use of the Service
                after notice of such changes will constitute acceptance of and
                agreement to any such changes. You further waive any right you
                may have to receive specific notice of such changes to these
                Terms and Conditions. You are responsible for regularly
                reviewing these Terms and Conditions. Subject to the right to
                opt-out as provided by Law, you consent to receipt of marketing
                and promotional materials from rental.kg via facsimile,
                email or otherwise. If any part of these Terms and Conditions is
                determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then the invalid or
                unenforceable provision will be replaced with a valid,
                enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of
                the original provision and the remainder of these Terms and
                Conditions will continue in effect. You shall not assign all or
                any part of this Agreement without Rental.kg’s prior
                written consent. The parties’ obligations hereunder are binding
                on their successors, legal representatives and assigns.
                Rental.kg’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you
                or others does not waive its right to act with respect to
                subsequent or similar breaches. Except as expressly stated
                herein, these Terms and Conditions, and all expressly
                incorporated agreements, constitute the entire agreement between
                you and rental.kg and supersede all prior or
                contemporaneous communications of any kind between you and
                rental.kg with respect to the Service. Sections 2-15 shall
                survive any termination or expiration of these Terms and
                Conditions.
